# Text-sentiment

This is part of Project 2 Phase 1

Use tkinter for GUI to take an input of a text, analyze it using Goodle's Natural Language Processing and output a text file showing the original text, the entities count and the overall sentiment qualifying it as -1 to -0.25 being negative, -0.25 to 0.25 being neutral and 0.25 to 1.0 being positive. To make the source code word work add the key.json file to the same directory.

This used Gettysburg's address as an example. "Output.txt" is test output.
